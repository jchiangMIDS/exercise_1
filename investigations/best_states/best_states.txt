The above conclusions are listed with 4 columns: State, scores, procedure, and variety. 
procedure is a quality score calculated by normalizing the different score scales by procedures to a 0.1 to 100.1 scale and excluding outliers.
variety is a representation of how many procedures available at the hospital out of total possible number or procedures on a 0.1 to 100.1 scale.
scores is a cumulative representation of both quality and variety by multiplying the two scores together.
The final query finds the average scores grouped by State and lists the top 10 scores.
By both normalizing the various scoring scales for procedure and calculating a cumulative score that accounts for quality and variety,
I am confident that the score yields an appropriate indication of which states have the most holistic high-quality care.
