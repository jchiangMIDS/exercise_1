The above conclusions are in 2 tables. The first is the top hospital survey results listed with 3 columns: Hospital_Name, base_score.
The second is from the best_hospital investigations showing top hospitals by quality and variety.
The base_score is a cumulative survey score calculated based on HCAHPS Base Score normalizing to a 0.1 to 100.1 scale excluding outliers.
The hospitals_and_patients query take the highest score average grouped by hospital_name and list it from high to low.

The results for the top hospitals by survey results and the top hospitals by quality & variety scores are a bit different. 
The reason for this centers around variety. In the survey results, patients are evaluating the hospitals only based on the available
procedures, so if a hospital has very few procedures but are rated high on the procedures they do have, they will be highly rate.
The best_hospitals question implored us to take in consideration of consistency across variety, hence I employeed a variety score that
docked hostpial quality scores the less procedures they had. This creates a cumulative best hospitals score that differs from the 
survey patient survey results. I find this to be acceptable. If we had wanted to see closer correlation, we can apply the same factor on 
variety of procedures available by hospital to the patient survey results.
